# World_Weather_Analysis

This is about using Python in a jupyter notebook in conjunction with APIs (google maps and opean weather). Here we used the APIs to retrieve information that was in JSON format, we created  dataframes, plots and maps using pandas, matplotlib, and google api respecitively. 

Our topic of choice is the weather, and we have examples of how to use that information to generate a heat map, and directions to hotels from the google api.

The information from these apis are exported as csv files.
